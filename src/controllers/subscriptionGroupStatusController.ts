  /**
   * This endpoint will attempt to reactivate or resume a cancelled subscription group. Upon reactivation,
   * any canceled invoices created after the beginning of the primary subscription's billing period will
   * be reopened and payment will be attempted on them. If the subscription group is being reactivated
   * (as opposed to resumed), new charges will also be assessed for the new billing period.
   *
   * Whether a subscription group is reactivated (a new billing period is created) or resumed (the
   * current billing period is respected) will depend on the parameters that are sent with the request as
   * well as the date of the request relative to the primary subscription's period.
   *
   * ## Reactivating within the current period
   *
   * If a subscription group is cancelled and reactivated within the primary subscription's current
   * period, we can choose to either start a new billing period or maintain the existing one. If we want
   * to maintain the existing billing period the `resume=true` option must be passed in request
   * parameters.
   *
   * An exception to the above are subscriptions that are on calendar billing. These subscriptions cannot
   * be reactivated within the current period. If the `resume=true` option is not passed the request will
   * return an error.
   *
   * The `resume_members` option is ignored in this case. All eligible group members will be
   * automatically resumed.
   *
   *
   * ## Reactivating beyond the current period
   *
   * In this case, a subscription group can only be reactivated with a new billing period. If the
   * `resume=true` option is passed it will be ignored.
   *
   * Member subscriptions can have billing periods that are longer than the primary (e.g. a monthly
   * primary with annual group members). If the primary subscription in a group cannot be reactivated
   * within the current period, but other group members can be, passing `resume_members=true` will resume
   * the existing billing period for eligible group members. The primary subscription will begin a new
   * billing period.
   *
   * For calendar billing subscriptions, the new billing period created will be a partial one, spanning
   * from the date of reactivation to the next corresponding calendar renewal date.
