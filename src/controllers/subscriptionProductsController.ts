   * `"proration_date": "2020-12-18T18:25:43.511Z"`).

   * In order to create a migration, you must pass the `product_id` or `product_handle` in the object
   * when you send a POST request. You may also pass either a `product_price_point_id` or
   * `product_price_point_handle` to choose which price point the subscription is moved to. If no price
   * point identifier is passed the subscription will be moved to the products default price point. The
   * response will be the updated subscription.
   *
   * ## Valid Subscriptions
   *
   * Subscriptions should be in the `active` or `trialing` state in order to be migrated.
   *
   * (For backwards compatibility reasons, it is possible to migrate a subscription that is in the
   * `trial_ended` state via the API, however this is not recommended.  Since `trial_ended` is an end-of-
   * life state, the subscription should be canceled, the product changed, and then the subscription can
   * be reactivated.)
   *
   * ## Migrations Documentation
   *
   * Full documentation on how to record Migrations in the Chargify UI can be located [here](https:
   * //chargify.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4407898373531).
   *
   * ## Failed Migrations
   *
   * One of the most common ways that a migration can fail is when the attempt is made to migrate a
   * subscription to it's current product. Please be aware of this issue!
   *
   * ## Migration 3D Secure - Stripe
   *
   * It may happen that a payment needs 3D Secure Authentication when the subscription is migrated to a
   * new product; this is referred to in our help docs as a [post-authentication flow](https://maxio-
   * chargify.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/5405177432077#psd2-flows-pre-authentication-and-post-
   * authentication). The server returns `422 Unprocessable Entity` in this case with the following
   * response:
   *
   * ```json
   * {
   * "errors": [
   * "Your card was declined. This transaction requires 3D secure authentication."
   * ],
   * "gateway_payment_id": "pi_1F0aGoJ2UDb3Q4av7zU3sHPh",
   * "description": "This card requires 3D secure authentication. Redirect the customer to the URL from
   * the action_link attribute to authenticate. Attach callback_url param to this URL if you want to be
   * notified about the result of 3D Secure authentication. Attach redirect_url param to this URL if you
   * want to redirect a customer back to your page after 3D Secure authentication. Example: https:
   * //mysite.chargify.com/3d-secure/pi_1FCm4RKDeye4C0XfbqquXRYm?one_time_token_id=128&callback_url=https:
   * //localhost:4000&redirect_url=https://yourpage.com will do a POST request to https://localhost:4000
   * after payment is authenticated and will redirect a customer to https://yourpage.com after 3DS
   * authentication.",
   * "action_link": "http://acme.chargify.com/3d-secure/pi_1F0aGoJ2UDb3Q4av7zU3sHPh?
   * one_time_token_id=242"
   * }
   * ```
   *
   * To let the customer go through 3D Secure Authentication, they need to be redirected to the URL
   * specified in `action_link`.
   * Optionally, you can specify `callback_url` parameter in the `action_link` URL if you’d like to be
   * notified about the result of 3D Secure Authentication. The `callback_url` will return the following
   * information:
   *
   * - whether the authentication was successful (`success`)
   * - the gateway ID for the payment (`gateway_payment_id`)
   * - the subscription ID (`subscription_id`)
   *
   * Lastly, you can also specify a `redirect_url` within the `action_link` URL if you’d like to redirect
   * a customer back to your site.
   *
   * It is not possible to use `action_link` in an iframe inside a custom application. You have to
   * redirect the customer directly to the `action_link`, then, to be notified about the result, use
   * `redirect_url` or `callback_url`.
   *
   * The final URL that you send a customer to to complete 3D Secure may resemble the following, where
   * the first half is the `action_link` and the second half contains a `redirect_url` and `callback_url`:
   * `https://mysite.chargify.com/3d-secure/pi_1FCm4RKDeye4C0XfbqquXRYm?
   * one_time_token_id=128&callback_url=https://localhost:4000&redirect_url=https://yourpage.com`
   *
   * ### Example Redirect Flow
   *
   * You may wish to redirect customers to different pages depending on whether their SCA was performed
   * successfully. Here's an example flow to use as a reference:
   *
   * 1. Create a migration via API; it requires 3DS
   * 2. You receive a `gateway_payment_id` in the `action_link` along other params in the response.
   * 3. Use this `gateway_payment_id` to, for example, connect with your internal resources or generate a
   * session_id
   * 4. Include 1 of those attributes inside the `callback_url` and `redirect_url` to be aware which
   * “session” this applies to
   * 5. Redirect the customer to the `action_link` with `callback_url` and `redirect_url` applied
   * 6. After the customer finishes 3DS authentication, we let you know the result by making a request to
   * applied `callback_url`.
   * 7. After that, we redirect the customer to the `redirect_url`; at this point the result of
   * authentication is known
   * 8. Optionally, you can use the applied "msg" param in the `redirect_url` to determine whether it was
   * successful or not.
   *
   * @param subscriptionId  The Chargify id of the subscription
   * @param body
   * @return Response from the API call
